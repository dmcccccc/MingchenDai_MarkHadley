-Need to make Student and Song serializable.
-Look at JukeBoxGUI: I added some methods just to represnt what we need to make as button/events.

JukeBoxGui is main
-File for storing SongManager and StudentManager, playlist, currentUser: Mostly complete.
-Options for opening at previous saved state.
-Close JFrame actin:Save, dont save, cancel
-Button "addSong"
-Add PlaylistGUI
-Add UserStatusPanelGUI: Most of these methods/attributes should be accessible from JukeBox

-Rewrite JukeBox: in progress. Looking good.
-SongList is Sortable
-User Max song error message (addSong Button listener), currently this is a System.out.print() to the console, we need to make this a pop up?
User Max time error message (addSong button listener) same as above.

-Reset logic added to JukeBox (again)

-Add to SongManager a public method that returns all available songs. As JList?
-Add to JukeBox a pbulic method that returns all available songs. As JList?

-Add to JB remaining plays and remaining time methods for GUI to access.
